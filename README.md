In order for you to be able to fetch the trailers automatically when adding a movie, you'll need Google Cloud API key. In order to do that, you'll need to:

1. Get a Youtube API key
- Go to Google Developers Console and enable Youtube Data API v3. Then create a key from Credentials page.

2. Update the .env by adding your Youtube API key.
- YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_youtube_api_key

3. It's all set.
```

# Important Note:

## ðŸ”‘ Environment Variables

Before running the backend, create a `.env` file inside the `/server` folder with the following: 

JWT_SECRET=my_super_secret_key_123

You can use any string as the secret. This is required for login/register to work.
